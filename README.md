# Corpus-Creation-for-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Code-Mixed-Tamil-English-Text

Dataset Information: 
Understanding the sentiment of a comment from a video and image is an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. one such application is to analyze the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow such strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language often written in non-native scripts.  Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark
